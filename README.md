This mod removes the ability of all vanilla power generation items to generate power.

You must generate power by producing Power Credits using mined resources. These power credits must be fed into 
an EvilCorp Electric Co. transporter box. This will increase your pre-paid electricity allowance. 

Your current pre-paid electricity allowance can be seen using the special EvilCorp LCD.

You will also need an EvilCorp uplink antenna to receive power from the electric company.

Of course, building these items is quite expensive when you are just starting out.

Additionally, they are available only in large grid formats.

Consequently you will need to jump-start your first large grid using the one power producing item that is 
not owned by EvilCorp: the hand crank.
